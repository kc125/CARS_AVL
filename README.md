# Automotive Price Prediction & Industry Insights Using Data Science
This mini project explores how data science can be applied to the automotive industry through predictive modeling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and domain insights.

### Features:
Cleaned and analyzed a real-world car dataset containing price, brand, mileage, condition, and more.

Performed EDA to uncover brand-wise price trends, mileage stats, and market distribution.

Built a Linear Regression model to predict car prices using features like brand, year, mileage, and condition.

Evaluated model performance using RÂ² Score and MAE, and experimented with a Random Forest Regressor.

Visualized actual vs predicted prices and extracted key business insights.

### Additional Insights:
Created Power BI dashboards for interactive visualization.

Investigated advanced topics like ADAS integration, predictive maintenance, and digital twin potential.

Explored how data science is shaping the future of autonomous vehicles, EV battery analytics, and smart manufacturing.

### Tech Stack:
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib)
